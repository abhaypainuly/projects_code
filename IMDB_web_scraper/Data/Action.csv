Among the visitors was a slender woman, dressed in black, who secreted herself in the hospital, and, when all the others had gone, went to the bedside of Zigomar and administered an antidote for poisoning. She was none other than La Rosario, the accomplice of Zigomar. Almost instantaneous with the administering of the antidote, Zigomar opened his eyes and sprang from the bier. They were about to leave the room when the surgeon entered to take a portion of the skin from the bandit's arm, which was all the great detective desired as a recompense for the capture of Zigomar.

Later the bandit set a trap for the infuriated Broquet into which he unsuspectingly fell. When the detective was in this predicament, Zigomar offered him $250,000 if he would let him alone.

It is understood that he is to ""clean up"" the gang of outlaws in Morgan Gap, led by Duke Morgan, with whose pretty niece, Nan, de Spain is in love. Sassoon starts the trouble by a knifing, but de Spain catches him. The laugh is soon turned, though, for Sassoon escapes and soon after de Spain himself is wounded in a fight with about seven of the Morgan gang. He is severely wounded and falls from the horse. The horse runs away, and de Spain is left there unconscious. He is finally discovered by Nan, who cannot forget her resentment even when she sees that he is half dead. Later she learns the true story of his attack by her relatives and from his own lips the reason of his being a gunman. This was that his father was shot in the back by one of the mountaineers and soon after his mother had died from the effects of the shock, leaving him with a birthmark to commemorate his father's tragic death. Nan is won over to his side the more easily that she is already half in love with the handsome gunman. A few days later she helps him escape. Afterwards, although he takes every opportunity for seeing her, they seldom meet and her uncle very nearly succeeds in marrying her to her worthless cousin, Gale Morgan. Duke Morgan is thrown from his horse and seriously hurt. Nan comes to nurse him at the hospital, where de Spain has been since he was shot. De Spain leaves soon after her arrival, but comes to see her under the pretext of bringing supplies. It is while there that she at last surrenders to his pleading and consents to become formally ""engaged."" Gale learns of the affair and tells Duke. Nan is forced to confess her love for de Spain and her uncle tells her that she will never marry him. Gale wins old Duke's permission to marry Nan and the girl is kept a prisoner in her room until she will consent to marrying her cousin. One night de Spain gets the following message: ""Take me away from here as soon as you can."" He knows it is from Nan. He rides to the Morgan ranch, and overhears Duke and Gale planning Nan's marriage. He reveals himself and holds the men at bay while he and Nan, who has appeared, escape. Sassoon, a bad man, nearly kills de Spain, but the latter manages to get a successful shot at his enemy and they reach town, where he takes Nan to the home of one of his friends. Henry de Spain learns that old Duke Morgan was the one who killed his father. Nan, broken-hearted, starts back to her uncle to learn the truth. She tries to bring him to de Spain, but they are caught in a blizzard, and only saved by de Spain just as they are about to succumb. Duke tells de Spain that he and Sassoon both shot at his father, but that they never knew which shot proved fatal, and they learned, to their horror soon after, that de Spain was not the man they were after, who had killed a member of their clan. There is a make-shift wedding ceremony performed right there in the snow, for old Duke gives in at last to the lovers, but later at the settlement there is a more elaborate wedding, which serves to unite the two enemy factions."

Tom and Polly watch fascinated as the dis-embodied Hand writes (in flashback scenes, mostly.) Cronin and Professor Duvam wait in an adjoining room. The Hand writes that it (he) was a member of ""The Black Seven,"" a psychical and scientific research group in Paris and, because other scientists considered them crazy owing to their advanced theories, they and their meetings were kept secret. Five of these men were the victims of ""The Voice"" (also dis-embodied) in previous chapters, the sixth was Dr. Reynolds and the seventh was Emil LaRoux. The latter, not content, with proving astral bodies could be projected, was also convinced he could recall a soul at will, providing that the body in which the soul had lived on earth was preserved by a certain ancient process. The other members were convinced that no one would consent to being mummified alive. But LaRoux learned that he could easily dominate the will of Reynolds' wife, Irene. He told five of the members he had found his subject for the experiment. The one he didn't tell was Reynolds. A year later, deep in the heart of the African jungle on an expedition and in Reynold's absence, LaRoux made Irene his experiment victim, and left the camp with her mummified body and her infant child. In pursuit, Reynolds found LaRoux's dead body in the desert sand, with a note in his hand saying he had sent Irene's mummified body back to civilization to the five members not on the expedition and the baby son was to be the channeled means of communication with her in what LaRoux called ""The Living Death"". That night Reynold's was bitten by a snake and his servant cut off his hand to save his life. Later, a human arm was grafted to Reynolds' body and he discovered when his astral body was projected, only the missing hand was visible. He now had his method of revenge."

364|The Three Must-Get-Theres|1922|53 min|Action, Adventure, Comedy|7.0|This delightful burlesque of Alexandre Dumas' famous adventure narrative (and then-leading screen swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks' hit films) represented one of writer/director/star Max Linder's attempts to conquer Hollywood on its own turf. He'd been an enormous star in early silent cinema, influencing the style of such subsequent silent comedy luminaries as Charles Chaplin and Buster Keaton. But his health suffered after he was gassed fighting for France in World War I. Despite the support of Chaplin himself (among others), his subsequent career in America never reached the popular heights he had at home. The commercial failure of this final U.S. effort seems particularly bewildering now, since THE THREE MUST-GET-THERES holds up so well. This spoof has the antic star as Dart-in-Again, a rapier-wielding dandy with a lovelorn horse (pining for the cow it left behind in the country) and a tendency to make an idiot of himself whilst attempting to conquer the forces of tyranny. Making scant effort to hide its incongruous modern Southern California backdrops, the movie is full of gags both slapstick and absurdist. Critics gratefully received it at the time. Audiences? Not so much. - Dennis Harvey

490|Below the Line|1925||Action, Drama||"The suggestion that a dog leads a dull life does not apply to that of Rin-Tin-Tin in the screen melodrama, ""Below the Line,"" which is on view this week at Warner's. Rin-Tin-Tin has an eventful career from the time he was owned by the villain to the days when young Donald Cass befriended the animal. Actually Rin-Tin-Tin is the energetic hero of this story, being always busily engaged in either saving himself from a dangerous predicament or rescuing his young master and the heroine. In one of the early scenes Rin-Tin-Tin, now well-known to motion picture enthusiasts, is seen in a crate in the baggage car of a train. He does not take the actions of the baggagemaster in a kindly fashion, so that brute causes the dog to be tumbled out of the car, down an incline to a river. The animal is rescued from this dilemma, and from being a snarling animal he changes to a loyal, affectionate creature. As the story goes on a woman is murdered by Jamber Niles and the Sheriff endeavors to find the criminal through a piece of cloth and a button found in the dead girl's hand. Subsequently we have Donald being attacked by the bloodhounds and Rin-Tin-Tin at first holding them at bay and finally chasing them all away with their tails between their legs. Rin-Tin-Tin does nothing by halves, for he tracks the murderer himself and kills him. There are several good scenes in this picture, but it is on the whole an overdose of melodrama. There is the ceaseless deluge of rain, the poor heroine and the trouble-encumbered hero plunging through the woods, and titles that make one turn one's head away from the screen. One of the praiseworthy portions of this subject is where Rin-Tin-Tin climbs a tree, which is bent and old. He makes two or three attempts and finally pulls himself up to the straggling branches. Dog or no dog, this picture is one of those which to see once, is enough-aye, too much. Aside from Rin-Tin-Tin's performance there is nothing noteworthy about the acting of the principals."

911|Salamandra|1928|48 min|Action, Drama, Thriller|7.2|"A Socialist Realist distortion of Dr. Paul Kammerer's experiments in the inheritance of acquired character(istic)s -- the (not entirely anti-Darwinian) conjecture that certain changes the environment produces in an individual may spontaneously appear in the next generation. As recounted in Arthur Koestler's <u>The Case of the Midwife Toad</u> (1971), Kammerer (1880-1926) claimed that darkened footpads he had artificially induced in a toad had been passed on to its offspring. When it was discovered that his critical specimen had been injected with ink (though why and by whom is still unknown), his credibility was destroyed and he apparently suicided. Richard Goldschmidt's synopsis of the film in ""Research and Politics,"" <u>Nature</u> (1949), mocks it as Soviet propaganda in support of the inheritance of acquired characters: The importance attached to the subject is revealed by the facts that none other than the then all-powerful [People's] Commissar for [Public] Education, the highly cultured and intelligent Lunacharsky, is the author of the film, that his wife plays the leading lady and that Lunacharsky, playing himself, appears in one scene.... In a Central European University a young biologist (model Kammerer) is working. He is a great friend of the people and endowed with all the qualities of a Communist movie hero. Working with salamanders, he has succeeded in changing their colour by action of the environment. One day the supreme glory is achieved; the effect is inherited. The bad man of the play, a priest, learns of this, comes to the conclusion that the discovery will spell an end to the power of the Church and the privileged classes, and decides to act. He meets at night in a church... with a young prince of the blood whom he had succeeded in having appointed as assistant to Kammerer. (This is obviously a typical job for a German prince!) Here in the dark sacristy the plot is hatched. The prince (or the priest?) proposes to Kammerer that he announce his glorious discovery at a formal University meeting, and the scientist gladly accepts. During the following night the priest and the prince enter Kammerer's laboratory... open the jar in which the proof specimen of salamander is kept in alcohol, and inject the specimen with ink.... [A]t the University meeting... the young scientist... makes a brilliant speech announcing the final proof for the inheritance of acquired characters.... [Suddenly someone] takes out the salamander, and dips it into a jar of water. All the colour runs out of the specimen. An immense uproar starts and Kammerer is ingloriously kicked out of the University as an impostor. Some time later, we see the poor young scholar walking the streets and begging with an experimental monkey which had followed him into misery. He is completely forgotten until one of his former students... succeeds in finding him, finally, completely down and out, in a miserable attic. She takes the train at once to Moscow and obtains an interview with Lunacharsky..., who gives orders to save the victim of 'bourgeois' persecution. Meanwhile, the character of Kammerer has sunk so low that he decides to make an end of it. The very moment he tries to commit suicide, the Russian student returns with Lunacharsky's message and prevents him from taking his life. The last scene shows a train in which Kammerer and the Russian saviour are riding east and a large streamer reads 'To the land of liberty.'"

1,836|Hittin' the Trail|1937|58 min|Action, Adventure, Comedy|5.2|"This was one of the earlier uses of Robert Tansey's favorite plot (only the 3rd time he had trotted it out of the stable, but he got six more films out of it in later years) in which a group of outlaws (wrongly jailed this time) are let out to join up with the good guys against a worse bunch of outlaws. And, not unusual in the B-western genre, most of the production crew wore several hats; director Robert N. Bradbury and supervisor Lindsley Parsons wrote a song for Tommy Bupp, one of the actually good kid actors of the time who proved real quick-like that singing wasn't his strong suit, while Robert Emmett Tansey worked three jobs under three names... Robert Emmett on story and screenplay, Robert Tansey as the production manager and Al Lane as the assistant director. And, for a change, music director Frank Sanucci actually earned a composers' credit as he did write a song, as opposed to the multi-times some source keeps insisting on crediting him as a composer when he was really the musical director serving up canned music. Roving horse-trader Tex Randall (Tex Ritter) and Hank Hank Worden swap horses with a fleeing outlaw, The Tombstone Kid (Archie Ricks), and the pursuing Sheriff Grey (Ed Cassidy) comes along and arrests Tex as the man he was pursuing. But the man who framed the Tombstone Kid , saloon owner and leader of a horse-theft gang, James Clark (Earl Dwire), clears Tex and he is released. Clark then rigs the wheel at his saloon so Tex can win some money and buy the stolen herd of horses Clark can't get across the border, then has a henchman steal the receipt and also has plans to get the horses back. Tex and Hank swap herds with Dad Reed (Jack C. Smith), so Clark has him arrested for horse theft also. Things don't get much better for Tex and Hank until the Tombstone Kid shows up and shoots henchman Slug (Charles King just as he is about to shoot Tex. This is because when Tex swapped Tombstone a fresh horse back in the first reel, Tombstone thanks him and says something about casting ""bread upon the water"" (which Tex has to explain to Hank is from the Bible). They ride back to town with proof of Clark's double-dealing, and the sheriff lets Tombstone's six men out of jail, and they join Tex, their ranks now swollen to about fifty riders, to chase Clark and his gang across the plains in a chase-type scene much favored by director Bradbury over the years. That only leaves time for Tex to explain to Jean Reed (Jerry Bergh), the rancher's daughter, that he is really an agent for the Soutland Railraod, commissioned to pay a large price for the right-of-way through her father's ranch."

The PRC name did not yet exist when this film was made, nor does it appear on any of the prints or advertising connected with this film.

Heading the cast was 13-year-old World's Champion Junior Cowboy named Bobby Clack, who was well known by that name so Neufeld, for reasons unknown since his use of Clack was to cash in on Clack's rodeo reputation (who had already appeared in two films as Bobby Clack), promptly changed his name to Bobby Clark. Go figure. The film has Bobby Sawyer, 13-year-old World's Champion Junior Cowboy and star of Sawyer's Greater Attractions medicine show, averting the robbery of a bank in Halfway, Texas and the impressed and grateful citizens induce Bobby's parents, Doc and Minerva Sawyer to settle in the town, over the protests of daughter Nellie, who is determined to drag them to the ""big city"" where she plans on becoming a great star of the theatre.

2,415|Ridin' the Trail|1940|55 min|Action, Adventure, Music||"Another one of those many B-films that the paid ""expert"" researchers at a certain institute in Hollywood can't seem to figure out when and where it came from, so just appear to guess. This is neither a 1942 production nor release. It was filmed in April, 1939 as an Atlas Production produced by C. C. Burr for Spectrum Pictures Corporation distribution. The Atlas/Spectrum tent and fixtures folded before this could be distributed, and it was salvaged from the trash bin of undistributed films in 1940 by Arthur Ziehn---one of Hollywood's great ""junk"" dealers---and released on July 27, 1940, nearly a year after completion of the film. The only functional ""crew credit"" Arthur Ziehn has or deserves relative to this film is one of having Atlas Productions deleted above the title and shipping it out with ""Arthur Ziehm, Inc"" inserted where the Atlas/Spectrum credits had been. With the exception of the leading lady, Iris Lancaster in place of Claire Rochelle, the cast and credits for this film are virtually identical to the Atlas/Spectrum/Burr ""Two Gun Troubador"" from March, 1939. Plot has Fred Martin (Fred Scott) and sidekick Fuzzy Jones (Harry Harvey) saving Carmencita (Iris Lancaster) from the evil intents of Walters (Jack Ingram) and his minions, with hero Scott decked out with an all-white hat,shirt and (trust me) pants."

The theft becomes a matter of community interest when a rumor is circulated that Hettie Huston , daughter of the local banker, August Houston, has stolen the money in order to buy an expensive evening gown with which to dazzle Tom Martel, a young lawyer whose legal education was sponsored by Judge Weaver, whose daughter Margaret is also in love with Tom, and the young lawyer is torn between the sophisticated attractions of Hettie and the simple charm of Margaret. In order to save his daughter's reputation, August Houston is eager to have Mary Shoemaker's guilt established and to induce her to quietly leave town. Judge Weaver (not on the bench)defends her so heatedly that Huston institutes a slander-suit against his old friend, charging him with having damaged Hettie's reputation. Margaret feels that inasmuch as her father has financed Tom's legal education, it is his duty to defend her father. But Tom is smitten with Hettie and proposes to her, and refuses to side against her in the trial. As the trial proceeds, it becomes apparent that all the witnesses are testifying against Judge Weaver because Huston and his bank hold notes and mortgages on their homes and businesses. Tom can stand it no longer and determines to defend the Judge, even though it may mean breaking his engagement to Hettie, no matter how smitten he may be. When it is suggested that Judge Weaver started the rumor against Hettie because his daughter was in love with Tom and jealous of Hettie, Tom puts Margaret on the stand and asks her to refute the statement. Margaret cannot swear, under oath, that she doesn't love Tom; and, as a result of her admission of love, the case is lost. But Huston magnanimously declines to accept from Judge Weaver the judgment the court has awarded him, on condition that Mary Shoemaker be sent out of town. Judge Weaver, knowing that Mary was not the one who stole the money, declines the offer. Meanwhile, a group of the town's riff-raff decide to take matter in their own hands and set fire to Mary's House. BUT, Mary is inside the house."

2,569|Rodeo Rhythm|1942||Action, Drama, Music|5.8|"One of the rarest, which is okay as it seldom even appears on the want lists of dedicated P.R.C. collectors (especially those who have seen it), and one of the oddest of the ""who-let-this-out"" films. Filmed on location in the Kansas City area, with only B-western star Fred Scott and actress Loie Bridge the only two in the cast who had ever been in a film (and Scott had none after this), and the only other Hollywood connections were director Fred C. Newmeyer, who hadn't had a directing job since 1937 and who chose to be billed as Fred Neymeyer here; cameraman Edward A. Kull, billed as Eddie Kull and editor George Halligan, who may have assumed it wouldn't be seen by anybody and kept his own name on the credits. At this period in time, actress Loie Bridge was a Kansas City residence herself. Sister of actor Alan Bridge, the pair had their start in Kansas City co-managing a stock company at the Empress Theatre, before brother Al headed for Minneapolis and, later, the bright lights of Tinseltown. Loie stayed at home in Kansas City running stock companies, with an occasional role in California in early 1930's B-westerns that usually had brother Al in the cast. Loie left Kansas City for good it appears circa 1942-43 and had a fair career as a character actress. Roy Knapp, a Kansas City dry cleaner, opened a kid's riding academy in that city circa 1926 and,in a few years, his troupe of riding young daredevils (ages from 4 years old to late teens) were performing in rodeos and livestock shows all over the American Midwest. One of the riding stars of the troupe was a 5-year-old girl named (correct spelling) Roylene ""Small Fry"" Smith, who evidently became Donna Jean Meinke somewhere along the way, according to the cast listing on the IMDb. While the film is a showcase for Roy Knapp's ""Rough Riders,"" it is not a story of the group, although ""Knapp"" is the character role names for Scott and Bridge, who play brother and sister. She plays Tillie Knapp, struggling to keep the Knapp Orphanage open. The highlight event at the Orphanage each year is the annual summer vacation visit the kids make to the ranch of her brother Buck, who sends her money to pay for the trip. Alas, this year, Alex Twitchell, local money-bag version of Snively Whiplash, has purchased the mortgage due on the orphanage and the Knapp Ranch, and demands immediate payment. Tillie gives him all the money that had been saved for the trip. To keep the kids, orphans all, from being disappointed, her old vaudeville partner, Joe Stegge, takes her and the kids to the ranch in his truck. The kids learn that Uncle Buck and Aunt Tillie are in dire straits and enlist the aid of Jim Corey, a former member of the orphanage, and Ellie Knapp, Buck's daughter, to help them put on a rodeo and use the money to help Aunt Tillie. Whiplash, uh, Twitchell arrives and legally ties up all of Buck's property, which includes the ponies the kids were going to ride in the rodeo and pay off the old homestead. But Twitchell is in a car wreck, and the kids save his life by taking him from under the car and rushing him to the hospital. Twitchell releases the ponies and the rodeo is held and enough money raised to pay off the mortgage. But Twitchell says the money is for them and he not only is going to retire the mortgage himself, he is going to build them a bigger and better Orphanage. While producer Leo J. McCarthy wrote the story, he and the two other writers chose to be uncredited also or, at least, PRC chose not to credit them. Aside from the riding ability of the kids---and they were good---this film is a good measurement of the talent level of Kansas City stock company players at the time, which also indicates that Kansas City was among the last to know that Vaudeville had died. But Victor Adamson and Robert J. Horner made worse films without leaving California. Not by much, though."

This one finds Jack Slade (Mauritz Hugo) and Mary Conway,alias Blanche (Veda Ann Borg), being recognized as known and wanted crooks by deputy marshal Harry Stevens (Steve Clark) and, when he orders them out of town, Slade kills him.

Bob goes undercover as an outlaw and works his way into the gang, while Hoot poses as a Dude who goes about making fiery speeches on behalf of law and order. The Gibson role here is limited in the action scenes to none, as he and his Monogram stunt double, Ben Corbett, were both getting a bit long in the tooth for such, and the nominal second lead was played by a relative newcomer to the screen, Ralph Lewis (II) as a good guy/bad guy outlaw, who is not the same as the older Ralph Lewis (I) who was making films in the 30's. Rule of thumb here for those who don't know what either one looks like is that any Ralph Lewis credit in the 1930's belongs to (I) and any occurring circa 1943-47 belongs to (II)."

2,871|Mystery of the River Boat|1944|77 min|Action, Adventure, Crime|6.7|"""The Mystery of the Riverboat"" while ending each chapter with a cliffhanger is more episodic in nature than the usual Universal serial and somewhat similar to Universal's 1934 ""Tailspin Tommy"" in that aspect as some plot lines are completed as a story within the overall story. Plus, while some serials often contained a title song or motif throughout, this one has six songs scattered around and about performed by either Marion Martin - and we have no idea if she was dubbed or did her own warbling - and former Three Mesquiteer and future head Mouseketeer Jimmie Dodd, who did his own. The overly-plotted (for juvenile Saturday matinée audiences to keep up with over a period of 13 weeks) story finds three Louisiana families, the Langtrys, Perrins and Duvals, as co-owners of swamp land in the Louisiana bayou country. Unaware that the property contains rich ""nitrolene"" deposits, they are considering an offer from speculator Herman Einreich, who is well aware of the secret, having killed the scientist who discovered it and stolen his geological maps and notes. He boards a river boat, ""The Morning Glory"", heading for Duval's Landing. Others on the boat are the skipper, Captain Ethan Perrin, his daughter Jenny; Steve Langtry; Rudolph Toller; Bruno Bloch and Louis Shaber who represent a foreign faction also interested in the land; and a bearded man named Clayton, who is really the disinherited renegade son of the Duvals, Paul Duval, who thinks his brother Jean has cheated him out of his share of the Duval estate and going home to get even. With the aid of Batiste, ""Clayton"" murders Einreich, steals his maps and almost kills Steve and Jenny, who are saved by Napoleon, ship steward and Steve's friend. The Toller gang, assisted by ship entertainer Celeste Eltree, and headed by Rudolph Toller, pin Einreich's murder on Steve, who heads for the swamps at the end of chapter six, where he encounters some hostile Cajuns in Chapter 7, and ends up in a jail that ends up floating down the river when the levee breaks. But there are still six chapters to go, with lots of plot left, including chapter 12, where Steve, in a twist from the usual serial hero, manages to blow himself up as opposed to the villains doing it for him."

In this one, the hero is an investigator sent by the U.S. Army rather than the Texas Rangers, but the roots show quickly.

Disguised as an unshaven, seedy cowpuncher, Steve arrives in Benton, Oklahoma territory and witnesses the robbery of the post office by Duggan and Higgins, henchmen of Arnold Drew, who holds the contract to deliver the horses. Steve stops the two robbers but is wounded by the unseen Drew. The townspeople assume the unconscious Steve is part of the gang, and judge Clem Masters instructs a deputy to take Steve to the next town to have his head-wound treated. Drew orders Duggan and Higgins to ambush the wagon and kill Steve, but they shoot the deputy instead, and the team runs away with the helpless Steve. He is dumped over an embankment just as Donna Ross, Todd Wingate and Boone Talbot arrive on the scene.

This one has Robert B. Williams as some kind of scientist on an unnamed South Pacific island and he is making penicillin out of jungle mold at a time when penicillin was so new that all the players in the film pronounce it as ""pey-nen-sol-lon"" or something like that. Tom Neal is also there as some kind of guard or protector of Williams' work and is hacked off something fierce about it as his goal if to get off the island and into hand-to-hand action ""against the japs."" Before long an unidentified plane flies over the island and Neal has his pistol at the ready to shoot it down in case it is an enemy plane but a figure parachutes out and in parachutes none other than Ann Savage, who is there as Neal's replacement, although Neal now isn't as ready to leave as he was before. Then a man, George Lynn, washes ashore and is accepted as a crewman from a torpedoed American ship. Later, Williams is murdered, after some of his ""pey-non-sol-len or whatever"" samples disappear, and Neal concludes that either Savage, island-doctor J.Carroll Naish or Abner Biberman is the guilty party working for the Axis to get the penicillin formula. This isn't exactly Holmes-or-Chan sleuthing on his part as he knows he isn't guilty and the only people on the island, with the exception of three natives, are those he names as suspects. He doesn't know that a two-man Japanese submarine (with five or six Germans on board plus the two Japanese crewmen)is lurking offshore, but his list of suspects is basically correct, as none of the people from the sub have come ashore yet. Well, one has but he floated in. Discounting the floater, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that between Savage, Naish and Biberman, which one who can least bear scrutiny."

3,899|The Marshal's Daughter|1953||Action, Adventure, Music|5.7|"Produced by Ken Murray strictly as a vehicle for Laurie Anders, his curvy protégé from his television show and billed above the title and first billed in the cast as Laurie (""I-like-the-wide-open-spaces"") Anders, which was her catch-line phrase and how she was introduced and known. This is neither a comedy, satire or parody---missing badly on all attempts at such---and isn't much of a western either, even by bottom-of-the-barrel B-standards. The plot by veteran B-western villain player Bob Duncan, who did manage to write himself the best role in the movie, relative to there being no good roles in this movie, has town banker Anderson, the secret head of an outlaw gang, trying to organize a Cattleman's Association and not getting any takers. He sends for Trigger Gans to act as a persuader. But a mysterious, masked rider known as El Coyote begins to resist. El Coyote is of course Laurie Dawson, daughter of retired Marshal and rancher Ben Dawson, and her El Coyote role ensured that whoever stunt-doubled her would wear pads where no stunt man ever wore them, with the possible later exception of Dean Smith doubling Maureen O'Hara in ""McLintock."" The heroines that Dave Sharpe doubled in Republic serials weren't built like Laurie Anders. Producer Ken Murray, as a riverboat gambler named Sliding Bill Murray, rolls into town on the same stage as Trigger Gans, and then promptly engages Preston Foster, Johnny Mack Brown, Jimmy Wakely and Buddy Baer (in cameo roles) in a blackout-skit poker game written by himself, which had to have been even more painful for the participants than the viewers. Ralph Staub used to get better stuff than this in his ""Screen Snapshots"" just roaming around Columbia's backlot and interviewing Smiley Burnette and Ringeye."

This one is set during the time of the Crimean War and the efforts of the Allies to take the Russian naval base at Sebastopol. Jean Pierre Aumont and Richard Stapley are guardians of a new cannon that can pierce the walls of the Russian fortress, and also rivals for the favors of nurse Karin Booth who, as it turns out, is a Russian spy. Not a spoiler...somebody had to be. The Russians kidnap Stapley (in his pre-Richard Wyler days)to learn from him the secret of the new cannon. Aumont is assigned to rescue him. Oh, okay he says and sets out. On the way he encounters a gypsy family that includes Paulette Goddard as a daughter---beginning to sound like Ray Milland and Marlene Dietrich in ""Golden Earrings"" in a different time and another war--- and Aumont disguises himself as a gypsy and locates Stapley. The success of his task was guaranteed the instance the name of writer Robert E. Kent appeared on the screen about 58 minutes earlier, allowing 10-12 more minutes for Aumont and Stapley to win the war. Miss Goddard had already phoned in her performance and gone home."

Typical of the atmosphere are the boy's words to her: ""If mother was not my mother I would hate her."" ""If father was not my father I would hate him."" The boy eventually finds a poor peasant girl and has a beautiful love affair. But soon his mother appoints this girl to be the son's concubine. As the real wife had so far born no child, if the concubine should be the first to bear a child, the wife and the concubine would exchange their status. In this situation the boy refuses to sleep with his beloved. His mother tries to whip the girl into seducing the boy, and when she fails the mother murders the girl. In this hell the boy finally finds a solution. He is the obstacle which prevents his father from rebelling against the emperor. If he did not exist the father would do so. The son decides to commit harakiri, and is much relieved by this decision."

Soon, the poor prisoner is tossed into the arena, where he must do battle with ""The Thing,"" a fearsome giant invisible monster. Fortunately, the Thing knocks over a torch, starting a fire in the arena which incites a mass exodus, allowing Sindbad to escape. Sindbad visits Galgo, finally convincing the magician to reveal the secret of El-Carim's invincible rule: the madman has had his heart removed, and it is kept safe in a distant bell tower, guarded by supernatural forces. El-Carim insists that the Princess marry him, but she refuses, and so is slated for execution. Sindbad and his men traverse the swamps of horror in order to reach the tower of the evil heart. They encounter carnivorous vines, giant prehistoric monsters, volcanic lava pits and whirlpools on the way, finally battling an ogre with the multiple heads of a dragon. Outtakes of this ""Dragon-Ogre"" where used briefly in the movie ""Natural Born Killers"". When they reach the tower, Sindbad, with the aid of a hook, begins to climb the immense rope to the top of the tower. Sindbad reaches the top of the tower, and finds El-Carim's beating heart encased in crystal. The heart is protected by a giant hand, which chases Sindbad all around the bell tower. Sindbad throws the hook at the crystal, which dislodges the evil heart, giving El-Carim a heart attack. Sindbad then manages to vanquish the monster hand. Seeking to protect the heart, El-Carim flies in a winged chariot towards the tower, accompanied by Galgo. Sindbad is about to impale the evil heart when El-Carim arrives on the scene. The two have a fierce swordfight while Galgo steals the wretched heart, and tosses it over the side of the tower. As it falls to the ground, El-Carim faints, and falls to his death. The entire kingdom then has a celebration for the marriage of the Princess and Captain Sindbad."
